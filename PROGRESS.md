## Not Started (Phase 4+)

- [ ] F33: Full team/player name customisation
- [ ] F34: Season/battle pass
- [ ] F35: IAP stubs
- [ ] F36: Rewarded ads
- [ ] F37: PWA service worker + offline
- [ ] F38: Knockout bracket tournament

## Known Issues

- F09, F25, F27, F29, F32: Implemented but lack automated E2E tests
- F28 (gestures): Only testable on touch devices, no Playwright coverage
- Some systems (DRS, weather, injuries) have no automated verification

## Decisions Log

- **Single-file architecture**: All game code in one `index.html` — keeps deployment trivial, avoids build tooling. Will split when file exceeds ~10K lines.
- **Playwright over unit tests**: E2E tests against real browser cover interface mismatches that unit tests miss. Worth the slower run time.
- **50-card pool before economy**: Content depth before monetisation — players need enough cards to feel collection variety.
- **Indianized names**: All player/team/sponsor names are Indian — legal compliance (no real player names) + audience fit.

## Next Session Checklist

1. Read this file for current state
2. Read `feature_list.json` for system-level status
3. Run `npx playwright test` to verify repo is green
4. Pick next feature from `feature_list.json` (state: `not_started`) or address known issues
5. WIP=1: finish and verify one feature before starting next
